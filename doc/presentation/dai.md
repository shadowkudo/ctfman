  - Demo of the web application (with the current content it will be short)

## Topics ?

### Api / Client structure

There would be a lot (maybe too much) to say

- CORS
  - Required TLS/SSL
  - Multi layered problems
  - Session cookies in multi origin context
- Deployment
  - Static site that points to the backend
  - Possible alternatives
  - Dedicated compose.yml

### Project structure

- MVC pattern
- Documenting an endpoint with OpenApi
- Dependencies
  - Logger
  - DB thread pool

### Security

- Session tokens
- BCrypt

### Planification

- GitHub Projects
- Git flow

### Pain points

- Scope creep
- Over complexification
- Fiddling with de/serialization
- Javalin apis with a lack of proper documentation
